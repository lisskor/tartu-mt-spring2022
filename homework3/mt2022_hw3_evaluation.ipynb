    "In [practice session 4](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yQM8c_idzBLO0efPQ9crrjZPyqvhqaLG?usp=sharing), we trained a text classification model on the IMDb dataset using BERT's sentence representations. We used a randomly selected part of the dataset, froze all layers of the pre-trained `bert-base-uncased` model, and only trained the classifier itself, which takes the final-layer representation of the [CLS] token as input. In this task, you will try to apply a different strategy to the same task.\n",

    "Train a binary classifier based on embeddings produced by a BERT-like model. You may use `bert-base-uncased`, as we did in the lab, or any other model of the same class. You may employ any strategy except the one used in practice session: for example, you can fine-tune the whole model and have a classifier on top of the [CLS] token, or extract embeddings from the model first and then train an independent classifier using those (see [this post](http://jalammar.github.io/a-visual-guide-to-using-bert-for-the-first-time/)). You can use the output of the last layer, any intermediate layer, or a combination of several layers. Instead of using the embeddings of the [CLS] token, you can use an average of embeddings of all words of the text. You can try changing the learning rate, the number of training epochs, and other hyperparameters.\n",
